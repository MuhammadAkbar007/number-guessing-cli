* Difficulty levels:
    * `Easy`: 10 chances to guess.
    * `Medium`: 5 chances to guess.
    * `Hard`: 3 chances to guess.
* Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
* Tracks the number of attempts and displays a congratulatory message when the number is guessed correctly.
* Option to play multiple rounds.
* Shows the time taken for each game.

## How to Play
1. The game will welcome you and prompt you to select a difficulty level.
2. You will have a limited number of chances to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, you will receive feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.

## Sample Output
*** Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! ***
I'm thinking of a number between `1` and `100`.

```java
Please select the difficulty level:
1. Easy (10 chances)
2. Medium (5 chances)
3. Hard (3 chances)
Enter your choice: 2
```

Great! You have selected the Medium difficulty level.
You have 5 chances to guess the correct number.

```java
Enter your guess: 50
Incorrect! The number is less than 50.
You have 4 chances left.

Enter your guess: 25
Incorrect! The number is greater than 25.
You have 3 chances left.

Enter your guess: 35
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 3 attempts.
You took 10 seconds to finish the game.

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no
```
Thank you for playing! Goodbye.
